# understading-karatsuba-algorithm-for-fast-multiplication-using-python
this is just a basic python program for understanding  "Karatsuba" algorithm multiplication. where you can multiply 2 digit or more number
this is maximum 2x2 multiplication.
you can enter number row wise .
if you have 1 number in first row you can just simply add "0" and then the number example: you want to multiply 4x36 just enter 04 in first row and then 36 in second row similarly in the 2nd row.
--- I know this is not a good code/program I can't even call it algorithms but it is just a step to understanding a very fast multiplication method --
